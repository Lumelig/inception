make
```

### 🛑 Stop (keep your data)

make stop
```
Stops and removes containers. Your data stays safe.

### 🗑️ Full reset (deletes everything)

## 🌐 How to open the website

### ⚙️ Before you start

Check that `$(USER).42.fr` points to localhost in your `/etc/hosts` file:
```bash
grep $(USER) /etc/hosts
# you should see: 127.0.0.1 $(USER).42.fr
```

If it's not there:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
# Add this line:
127.0.0.1 $(USER).42.fr
# Save with Ctrl+X → Y → Enter
```

### Open the website
Go to:
```
https://$(USER).42.fr
```
Your browser will warn you about the certificate. This is normal, for a self-signed certificate.
 click **Advanced** → **Accept Risk and Continue**

### How to open the admin panel

```bash
https://$(USER).42.fr/wp-admin
```
